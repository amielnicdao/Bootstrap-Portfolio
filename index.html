        <p>
          I am an aspiring software developer. I have experience in the accounting industry, but I feel the work
          to be drudging and slow.
          I need excitement and constant mental stimulation to find the work interesting enough to do.
          Having started a project that I plan on turning into a startup, I got acquainted with the developer
          industry and was hooked!
          The ability to create something from nothing gets me going and I find the whole startup ecosystem
          intriguing.<br><br>

          When I am not at work or in class or working on my project, I can be found in the foodie scene and
          searching for the best ramen in the area.
          I love traveling and taking random day trips. I have an affinity for water-related activities such as
          speed boating, jet skiing, and surfing.
          Researching ways to achieve peak performance is one of my favorite past times as well as watching scary
          movies and the occasional corny Filipino
          movie. Being a coffee and chocolate connoisseur, if you bring me coffee and chocolate (no white choco
          please!), I will be your forever best friend.
